C Foul Magics (Part 2)|QID|673|N|Mount up and ride to Stromgarde Keep. As you enter go left at the first occasion. Clear your way through until you reach a big dark house. Go behind the house and you should be at (29,63) approx. Marez Cowel spawns at that location, in front of the butcher table. If she is not there, she can also be found on the second level, in a small square-shaped area above the above described spawn point (in the next area of the keep).|
C The Broken Sigil|QID|640|N|Fight your way back to where you went left earlier and go right instead (still on the lower level). You should see two ways now. One going south and one going west. Go west and kill every Stromgarde Defender/Troll Hunter/Vindicator you come accross.(23.95,60.45)|
C The Real Threat|QID|680|N|Once that is done go back to the intersection from before and instead of going west, go south. You should see ogres and trolls there. Clear your way down then straight until you see a tower. Clear your way around the destroyed houses and search for Or'Kalar. Possible spawnpoints: (18.68,66.39) (19.54,68.25) (20.97,65.53)|
