N Poison Quest Chain|C|Rogue|N|While you don't need to do this chain anymore to get the poisons skill, it does reward the Thistle Tea recipe. If you are a cook, this is a very uesful recipe for high end PVP and PVE for rogues. However, you can also easily come back and do this at higher level. If you would like to complete it now, talk to Shenthul (43.1,53.5) and accept "The Shattered Salute". Please note that you will need a lockpicking skill of 70 to complete this quest.|Z|Orgrimmar||T|

There are a couple possible methods of getting to it without actually killing all of the mobs in the room. You can die and rez next to the chest in the fireplace, where only the rifleman will be able to hit you. As a rogue, you can stealth down and sap the riflemen. Also, anyone with a pet to distract the rest of the room can do so, while he or she loots the chest. This is a very difficult quest for this level range - if you can't complete it, just abandon it and move on.|
