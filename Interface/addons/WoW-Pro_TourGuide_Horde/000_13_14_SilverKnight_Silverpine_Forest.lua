C Prove Your Worth|QID|421|N|Kill five Moonrage Whitescalps, while killing whatever Ferocious Grizzly Bears that you see (47.97,40.43). Make sure to avoid the woodland area directly west of the road, as level 21 elites like to path around and eat you. They apparently like the taste of lowbie in the morning. :(|

A Escorting Erland|QID|435|N|Make certain to kill any and all Mottled Worgs that you see for their hearts while heading slightly North.|
C Escorting Erland|QID|435|N|He complains about Worgs coming out of the woodwork to attack him. This isn't an exaggeration. Erland is also about as physically fit as an 82 year old cancer patient, so make sure he doesn't wind up tanking more than one, or he goes squish and you wind up with a small army of angry dogs on you.|
