R Darkcloud Pinnacle|N|Get down the lift and follow the road west until Darkcloud Pinnacle, find the slope going up on the northwestern side of the peak (31,36). Go up and across 3 wooden bridges, you'll end up at the top of a peak with 2 bridges, take the one on your left (going east), at the next peak there will be 2 bridges again, take the one on your right (going southeast).|
C Arikara|QID|5088|N|You should arrive on a last peak, with a bonfire in the middle named "Sacred Fire of Life". Clear everything on the peak, get back to full health/mana. Right-click the bonfire, it will summon Arikara, a level 28 mob. |
N READ THIS|N|Go back the way you came from, until you get off Darkcloud Pinnacle. Make sure your 5 minute special ability is up and that you have health pots ready etc. The next part is best done by 2 players so if you can group up with someone for the kill do so, solo it will be a bit hard, but try it anyway. I soloed this with my beastmastery specced hunter at level 31 using rapid fire and one mend pet.|
C Hypercapacitator Gizmo|QID|5151|N|Go northwest until you find a destroyed caravan (22,24) with a panther in a cage in the middle. Open the lock, kill the panther and loot the Hypercapacitator Gyzmo, then go south to Whitereach Post.|
T Arikara|QID|5088|N|Go west to Whitereach Post (south if you did the enraged panther quest) (21,31). |
T Hypercapacitator Gyzmo|QID|5151|N|If you did it, if not you can abandon that quest.|
C Steelsnap|QID|1131|N|Go west/northwest, we're now gonna look for a named hyena named Steelsnap. Go to the area which is north of highperch, Steelsnap always passes by that spot. Just kill everything in the area while waiting for Steelsnap to show up. I generally find her at (13,28). She's a level 30 hyena with two hyena guarding her. Just kill her quickly and run away, that's the easiest option, but any class can manage it with a bit of strategy.|
C Test of Endurance|QID|1150|N|Go southeast along the mountain until you reach the harpy cave called Roguefeather Den. Clear your way inside the cave until you reach the bottom, you should see some wooden crates in the corner. When you click them a named harpy will spawn.|
T Test of Endurance|QID|1150|N|Travel east to the Weathered Nook (54,44), go up the slope.|
A Test of Strength|QID|1151|
C Test of Strength|QID|1151|N|Go to the northwestern part of the zone to (17,37). Kill everything on your way. Rok'Alim the Pounder spawns at that point. Afterwards he roams around in that area a little. Search for him while killing stuff.|
T Test of Strength|QID|1151|N|Go back to the Weathered Nook.|
