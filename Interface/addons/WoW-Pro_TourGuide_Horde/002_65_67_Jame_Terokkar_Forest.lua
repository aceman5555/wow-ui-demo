N READ THIS |N|The next quest is kind of difficult. You fight off 3 waves of normal birds, they do a bit of damage but have low HP. Then you fight a big bird. He hits hard, 1k on cloth, but can be kited, polymorphed, hibernated, stunned, etc. Save your cooldowns for him if you can, and good luck!|

N Repair, restock and vendor junk.
N Level Check: 65|N|If you aren't level 65 yet, go to the Shadow Tomb (31,53) and grind the cabal agents there until you are level 65 with 50000XP in the level. This spot is quite decent for money making, but most importantly you'll get a lot of Marks of Kil'Jaeden for your Aldor faction. I suggest to turn them all in immediately when you get back to Shattrath, because they will become useless once you're honored with the Aldors. They can be turned it at the Aldor's tier, the quest is called [65] Marks of Kil'jaeden.|
