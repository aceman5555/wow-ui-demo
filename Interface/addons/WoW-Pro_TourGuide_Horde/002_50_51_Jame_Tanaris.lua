C The Scrimshank Redemption |N|Find the entrance spiralling down at (55.65,70.25). Take the 2nd tunnel you see when going down the spiral, the one going north (55.78,68.90).

T Find OOX-17/TN!|O|N|Find the chicken at (60.2,64.7), turn in the quest and accept the follow-up.|
A Rescue OOX-17/TN!|O|PRE|Find OOX-17/TN!|N|At (60.2,64.7)|
C Rescue OOX-17/TN!|QID|648|O|N|Let the chicken in front, let him get hit first. Sometimes mobs will aggro him but not manage to hit him while he walks and they will just give up. The first part of the escort is the hardest as you will run into lvl 46-47 mobs. And at some point you will get an ambush of 3 level 46 scorpions. Use your long cooldown abilities there. After this, it gets easier. Later on you will get a 2nd ambush, 3 humanoids lvl 42 (green). One will be a shadow mage though, kill it first.|
