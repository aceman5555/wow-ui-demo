R Jintha'Alor |N|Ride to the path (77, 61) up and head to the top. Ride to Jintha’Alor (66, 64)|
N Things to do|N|In this area, you'll be looking for Vessels of Tainted Blood as you go. Also kill Vilebranch Berserkers, Shadow Hunters, Blood Drinkers and Soul Eaters. You need nothing from the first two levels, so get to the third level as quickly as possible.
N Pile of Bones |N|Keep killing trolls and looting vessels. At the top of the stairs to the sixth level, to the left is a pit with oozes. Fight your way through to the heart of the pit where you should see a pile of bones (62.2,75.5). Loot it.|L|19070|
C Separation Anxiety |N|On the top level, you'll see an altar with a troll lying on it. Don’t go down into the pit yet but go around it until you see a stone gate with a path leading to the other pair of stairs and a cave. Follow that way until the very end where you should see an area shielded by stone walls (there should be two more of those on your way). You should see wolves in there. Kill them and loot the pile of bones (58.6,64.9) inside.|QID|7849|
T Kidnapped Elder Torntusk! |QID|7845|N|Go back to the big stone pit with the quest npc. Clear your way into the pit and check next to the altar, there should be Vile Pristress Hexx (If she isn’t there, she roamed into the cave but she’ll come back). Single pull and clear as many trolls in that altar area as possible. The priestess casts an annoying polymorph spell, which doesn't break on damage, so watch out for that, try to interrupt it and burn her down quick. When you are full mana pull the priestess. |
A Recover the Key! |QID|7846|
C Recover the Key! |N|Now comes a rather difficult part, if you are confident that you can handle 3 mobs alone you can proceed solo, if you think you’d have difficulties, try to group up with someone. Go inside the tunnel behind the altar and fight your way through to the southernmost tip of the tunnel structure (57.5,86.5). There you should see Hitah’Ya the Keeper patrolling with two guards. Get full mana/hp. The trick here is to use crowd control (if you have, like ice trap, sheep, sap) and at the same time burn down Hitah’Ya as fast as possible (she has very little HP). Also pop your cooldown skills to burn down one of the guards as fast as possible. Once that is done you just need to deal with the other guard. Loot Hitah’Yah. | |QID|7846|
C The Ancient Egg |O| |N|If you took the quest [51] The Ancient Egg, don't forget to get the egg off the pedestal in the center of the room Hitah'Ya the Keeper was in. | |QID|4787|
C Wanted: Vile Priestess Hexx and Her Minions |QID|7861|N|Kill the Priestess if you haven't already, and any guards you still need.|
T Recover the Key! |N|Go back to the altar and turn in the quest. | |QID|7846|
A Return to Primal Torntusk |QID|7847|
C Dark Vessels |N|Finish getting any Vessels of Tainted Blood you still need, while killing any Vilebranch Berserkers, Shadow Hunters, Blood Drinkers and Soul Eaters you still need.|QID|7850|
C Job Opening: Guard Captain of Revantusk Village |N|Finish killing Vilebranch Berserkers, Shadow Hunters, Blood Drinkers and Soul Eaters. | |QID|7862|

R Revantusk Village |N|Now time for a suicide run. Mount up and jump down from terrace to terrace, if you survive, great! If you die, that's great too! Just release your spirit and take the spirit raise (77,77). |
