C Bloodscalp Ears|QID|189|N|Go south and down the plateau until you find the troll camp at Bal'lal Ruins (29,20). It should take a while to get 15 Bloodscalp Ears, 9 Bloodscalp Tusks, 1 Bloodscalp Totem and 25 Bloody Bone Necklaces, but it is a nice grinding spot anyway. If you don't have enough trolls there is another camp northeast at the Tkashi Ruins (33,15).

C Singing Blue Shards|QID|605|N|Once you've collected all of that, go west to the shore and move along the shore towards the north until you find Crystal Spine Basilisks.

C The Vile Reef|QID|629|N|After that go take a swim until you reach the loc (24,22), right under you should be some ruins guarded by murlocs. Against one of the outer walls of those ruins you should see a big tablet, if you put your pointer over it the cog should appear and it should say "Gri'lek the Wanderer" (it should also sparkle). Dive and click the tablet to loot the  Tablet Shard, you should be able to do that without aggro'ing any murlock.|

T A Donation of Silk (Orgrimmar)|QID|7827|N|You should have the cloth stacks from the shopping list by now, if you don't have them, buy as much as you still need from the AH. Go to the Horde Cloth Quartermaster Vehena in the Valley of Spirits in Orgrimmar.|
N Things to do|N|Another last thing before you go, if you don't have the cooking profession yet, go learn it. Talk to a city guard and ask him for a cooking trainer. You don't need to level cooking up, you just need to train the profession and to become an Apprentice Cook, it will unlock some cooking quests for easy XP. Grab the 10 Turtle Meat you saved when we were in the Shimmering Flats, and you're finally ready to go again.|
