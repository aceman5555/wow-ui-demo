C Elixir of Agony (Part 3)|QID|515|N|Go east and across the river, until you find nagas at (58,64). Kill them until you have 5 Daggerspine Scales.|
C Helcular's Revenge (Part 1)|QID|552|N|Go northwest to the Yeti Cave (46,30). Kill yetis until you get Helcular's Rod, which is kinda rare, so just kill a lot of yetis. It might take a long time, so be patient. If it really takes more than 20 minute, try to log out and then back in. For some reason this worked for me a couple of times and the rod dropped on the first few kills after I logged back in, after a 20 minute yeti slaughter with no success.|
