K Varlam |N|A wolf rider, gead back to the path and further up on the left there's another camp at (85,24), Varlam is here.| |Q|Hour of the Worg|QO|Varlam slain: 1/1|
K Goremaw |N|A large wolf; he's on the southern side of the tower at (86.70,27.20).| |Q|Hour of the Worg|QO|Goremaw slain: 1/1|
C Hour of the Worg |QID|12164| |N|Arugal is on top of the tower. He has 4 phases. Phase one he shadowbolts for ~1500 damage. At 75% HP, he goes into P2, summoning 3 adds. Kill them to return to P1, which lasts until 50%. Then he'll MC someone, who you bring down to 35%, then he goes back to P1. At 25%, he repeats P2, except with 9 adds. Sasha helps in the final phase. If you're ranged, you can probably kill him by LoSing his shadowbolts, if you're far enough down the adds won't aggro on you, but will despawn instead. Good luck!|

N Things to do |N|That's it for Grizzly Hills, you can do the group quests now if you haven't already. Otherwise, time for Zul'Drak (at least, when the guide is released :P). In the meantime, you may wish to go to Sholozar Basin, questing there is very intuitive and good experience.|
