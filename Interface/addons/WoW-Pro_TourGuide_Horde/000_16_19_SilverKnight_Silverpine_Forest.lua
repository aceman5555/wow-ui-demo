C Ambermill Investigations|QID|479|N|Kill every humanoid that moves for their Dalaran Pendants (58.00,62.25). The Protectors like to spawn level 1 critter adds that can be one shotted, but can be irritating. Kill them extra dead.|

C A Recipe For Death (Part 2)|QID|450|N|Fight your way through to (42.98,73.27) and click on Berard's Bookshelf to get his journal. You also more than likely will have to kill Apothecary Berard to get to said bookshelf, since he's all protective of his junk and...junk.|

N Lake Skulker Moss|N|Head East and kill Lake Skulkers for Lake Skulker Moss (70.77,36.97) (clever, ne?). Melee will hate these buggers, because of a debuff that randomly has you dropping your weapon whenever you attack. They also like to respawn quickly and beat you down while you're bandaging. So much hatred. But I digress.|L|3256 6|

N Lake Creeper Moss|N|If you think anything but Lake Creepers drop Lake Creeper Moss, seek medical attention now. These guys have a similar debuff as their Skulker cousins, only instead of knocking your weapon out of your hand, they knock you down entirely (77.16,29.20).|L|3257 6|

A Pyrewood Ambush|QID|452|N|Head to Pyrewood and kill everything in sight for Pyrewood Shackles.
C Pyrewood Ambush|QID|452|N|It's a straight forward quest. It's a semi-gauntlet of mobs--first one, then two, then two waves of three. I ignored it last trip down here because a few classes (coughPriestscough) would probably get destroyed at a lower level due to the number of mobs. But it should be easily handled at 18.|

C Arugal's Folly (Part 4)|QID|99|N|(45.34,73.63)|

C A Husband's Revenge|QID|530|N|Head South (46.59,83.84)--avoiding yet another Son of Arugal that likes to own you randomly--and find Valdred Moray pathing around the dozen or so NPCs near the Gilneas gate. It's difficult to get to Moray without clearing an area for him to walk into. The best way is to find a small group of two mobs and kill them. It's doubtful you can take two at once, so pick one off and run away until you drop combat to kill the other. Once that's done, wait for Moray to walk far enough away from other mobs to come solo, and used a ranged attack on him.|

C Beren's Peril|QID|516|N|Head into the fairly secluded cave at (60.66,72.84) and kill six Ravenclaw Drudgers and Ravenclaw Guardians. Another quest where you'll have to be patient and grab mobs carefully from long range. Head North, when done.|

C Tools of the Trade|QID|1999|C|Rogue|N|(64.27,63.77)|
C The Weaver|QID|480|N|Archmage Ataeric (63.49,64.27) by himself isn't ridiculously difficult--it's the dozen or so mobs outside of his run down shack that will make your life unhappy. It's yet another quest where you have to pick off mobs one at a time and hope one of the billion patrols don't suddenly decide to play "Kill the Lowbie Horde".|

N A Talking Head|N|Kill Gnolls until A Talking Head drops (67.95,24.85).|L|3317|
T Resting in Pieces|QID|460|N|Turn this quest in at the dirt pile with legs (67.95,24.85) known as the Shallow Grave.|
A The Hidden Niche|QID|461|

C Assault on Fenris Isle|QID|442|N|Head to the center of the building, and fight your way up the winding stairwell. From there, try to grab one or two of the Gnolls waiting at the top without aggroing the one or two Gnolls on the other side of the open doorway. When they die, go through the door on your left, clear up the sloping ramp, and into the main building--(65.74,23.64)).|U|3251|
T The Hidden Niche|QID|461|N|From there, head back into the previous hall, but head up the tower stairs (65.32,24.84).|
