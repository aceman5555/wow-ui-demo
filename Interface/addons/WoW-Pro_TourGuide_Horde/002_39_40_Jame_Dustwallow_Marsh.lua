The Ooze Buster is used to dissolve oozes all around the crashed zeppelin wreck. You can only use the buster while you energized by the blue rays though (which are being shot by power core fragments). The power core fragment next to Moxie always shoots energy at you so stay as much around that fragment and pull oozes to it. Once they are close use your Ooze buster on them. This will dissolve the oozes and you'll get a quest update. You need to do this 10 times and loot 8 Zeppelin Cargos at the same time.|
