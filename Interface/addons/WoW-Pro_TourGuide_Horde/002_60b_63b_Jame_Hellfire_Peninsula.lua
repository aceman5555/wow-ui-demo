C The Demoniac Scryer |QID|10838| |N|Time for a challenge! Head over to Hellfire Basin, at (45,49). Find yourself a clear spot, and HP/mana up. When you use the item, you'll have to defend the crystal from waves of very weak imps, and occasional orc spawns, which should be taken down immediately. The crystal can take some beating, though. Once smoke starts shooting upwards, talk to the crystal to finish the quest.| |U|31606|
