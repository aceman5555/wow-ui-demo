N The yeti cave|N|Head west to the yeti cave. Go inside the cave, and look for the 2 braziers named Flame of Azel and Veraz. Right click them to turn them off. |Q|Helcular's Revenge|QO|Flame of Azel charged: 1/1|QO|Flame of Veraz charged: 1/1|
C Infiltration|QID|533|N|Get out of the yeti cave, go north and slightly northeast, find the plateau named Corahn's Dagger  (48,81). You'll find a syndicate camp there.|
N Fresh Carcass|L|5810|N|Once you have the Syndicate Missive, go west, you should quickly stumble upon a camp with alliance npcs, don't get too close or they will aggro you and you'll die quickly. To the north you should see a narrow path to Alterac Mountains (42,77). Before you go through this pass, kill some lions in the area until you get a Fresh Carcass.|
C Helcular's Revenge (Part 2)|QID|553|N|Go through the snowy path, you should be able to locate a yeti cave soon at (37,68). Clear yourself a way inside the cave, then click the Flame of Uzel.|
C Frostmaw|QID|1136|N|Get back to full health/mana, and check if your potion timer is ready, because we're about to summon a level 37 yeti, Frostmaw. When ready, place the Fresh Carcass on the Flame of Uzel and wait a little bit, frotmaw should show up within the next 20 seconds.|
C Prison Break In|QID|544|N|Exit the cave, go west back to the plains area in Alterac Mountains and then southwest until you find the Lordamere Internment Camp (21,82). Kill everything in the camp, including the non agressive undead npcs. You can get stone tokens from the Dalaran Guards and Theurgists, and the Bloodstones from the undead npcs: Ricter, Alina, Dermot and Kergan Darkmar. Kergan is in the other house, on the 2nd floor. He's guarded by a level 36 mob, Warden Belamoore so kill this one first, then kill Kergan and loot the last Bloodstone. You don't need Belamoore's Journal for anything, it is just lore, you may destroy it.|

T Helcular's Revenge (Part 2)|QID|553|N|Now is the time for one of those missions: impossible. Head southwest to the river and follow it until you have the alliance town of Southshore in view. Not too close or you'll get aggro from the guards, they'll see you from very very far. (55,52) is a good spot. With maxed clip plane you should see Helcular's grave, which is at the eastmost tip of the southshore graveyard. Wait till the 3 guards patrolling close to this area are as far as possible then sprint for the grave, right click it, complete the quest log which just showed up as quick as possible and then run for your life, back the way you came from. You will most likely get aggro and die, but that's ok!|
