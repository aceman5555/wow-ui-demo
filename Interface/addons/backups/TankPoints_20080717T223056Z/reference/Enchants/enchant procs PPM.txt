Rogue enchant priorities 

Combat rogue mainhand PvE: 
crusader >= lifesteal > fiery > +15agil >> +5dam >= +15str >>> unholy = icy 

Combat rogue mainhand PvP: 
lifesteal >= crusader > fiery > +15agil >> +5dam >= +15str >>> unholy = icy 

Dagger rogue mainhand PvE: 
+15 agil = crusader >= lifesteal = +5dam >= fiery > 15 str >>> unholy = icy 

Dagger rogue mainhand PvP: 
+5dam = +15 agil = lifesteal >= crusader = fiery > 15 str >>> unholy = icy 

Offhand (all): 
+15 agil >= lifesteal >= crusader > fiery > 15 str >>>>> +5dam > unholy = icy 

> better than 
>> much better than 
>> much much better than 
>= better than or equal to (very close)

Rogues, Instant Attacks and Procs 
- Rogues have a real advantage when it comes to mainhand weapon procs. Procs are calculated as procs per minute, however this is internally expressed as a percentage value per attack. This means that when you spam 3 sinister strikes in the beginning of a fight your fiery enchant has a 84% chance to proc with a 2.80 speed weapon. 
- Mainhand weapon procs tend to go off roughly 2X as often as their procs per minute would infer for combat rogues. 
- Mainhand weapon procs tend to go off roughly 1.5X as often as their procs per minute would infer for dagger rogues. 

Crusader 
- 75-125 point heal and +100 strength for 15 seconds 
- crusader on both weapons dualwielding does stack. Only one icon shows up but you get both heals and your strength goes up by 200. 
- crusader is by far the best weapon buff for non-rogues and hunters as they get 2 attack per strength 
- rogues get 1 attack per strength, so 100 attack or 7.14dps 
- 7.14dps = +7.14dps on mainhand and +3.6 offhand (or +5.36dps offhand with imp dualwielding) 
- the 7.14dps also adds to instant attacks. This is calculated by (weaponspeed * 7.14)= damage added to instants 
- crusader is a buff so it isn't resistable, thus it is the best mainhand enchant for PvE raids 
- crusader has a low procrate and a duration, so it is much less useful in PvP and soloing where it seems to always proc at the end of a fight 
- crusader procs at a rate of 1 proc per minute. Thus a 2.80 speed weapon would proc 1/(60/2.80)= 4.67% chance per proc 

Lifesteal 
- 30 point heal and 30 point fire (NOT shadow) damage per proc 
- lifesteal procs at a rate of 6 procs per minute. Thus a 2.80 speed weapon would proc 6/(60/2.80)= 28.00% chance per proc 
- lifesteal is better than crusader for PvP and soloing as it is atomic damage and healing 
- lifesteal does 3dps and heals 3hps per hand with autoattack alone 

Fiery 
- 40 point fire damage per proc 
- fiery does 4dps with autoattack alone 
- fiery procs at a rate of 6 procs per minute. Thus a 2.80 speed weapon would proc 6/(60/2.80)= 28.00% chance per proc 

15 agil 
- 15 agil = 15 attack = +1.07dps to mainhand and 0.54dps to offhand (0.80dps to offhand with imp dualwield) 
- 15 agil = 0.52% crit = 1.03% dodge 

15 str 
- 15 str = 15 attack = +1.07dps to mainhand and 0.54dps to offhand (0.80dps to offhand with imp dualwield) 

5 damage 
- adds a flat 5 damage to every attack 
- dps added is 5 / (speed of weapon), so on a 2.00 speed weapon like the barman shanker it would add 2.5dps to mainhand only 
- useful for mainhand dagger rogues only 

Demonslaying 
- 75-125 holy damage against demons and a 5 second stun 
- don't know procrate 
- useful if you're grinding on satyrs, basically 

Unholy/Icy 
- unholy is worthless and icy has a very low procrate, don't bother 

Maelstrom/Heroism Cards 
- No real tests have been performed yet for these procs. Hearsay says they are 1 proc per minute per hand. If this is true, they are worthy of being purple.
