* If you have the Call to Arms daily quest and a battleground ends, we won't auto leave until it completes if you win. This is mostly for people who have auto leave set to 0 causing you to sometimes leave before getting credit in a win.

* This version should be pretty much beta with everything working well enough to test, so TEST IT!
* Fixed points from captures so it actually works now
* Added options to set specific macro text to run on click for carriers
* Increased party scan to 1 second instead of every 0.50 seconds
* Increased health time out to 10 seconds, and it makes sure we can't get data from them anymore before reseting
* Removed table recycling for inspection/player info, it's not something thats used often and it seems to be messing up when inspecting people

* Most of this needs more testing still, but it should mostly be the final implementation
* Configuration is now in, it's under SSPVP2 in OH
* Flag carrier module colors people name by class, shows health when available for both enemies and friendly carriers through UNIT_HEALTH and party target scanning, removes it if no updates for 5 seconds

* Fixed SSPVP:GetFactionColor() not doing a string.lowwer
* Fixed SSPVP:RegisterOOCUpdate() not working

* Added flag carrier tracking for WSG and EoTS
* Added sound playing when queues ready 
* Fixed server info not checking if their is more then 0 of a class before showing it

* Added /sspvp suspend, will disable auto join and auto leave for 5 minutes, or until you log off. Can remove the suspension early by doing it again
* Added config variable for disabling timers in AB0
* Added match info for AB, final score for both factions, time left and bases to win
* Added blocking of marks of honor creation

* Fixed overlay not nilling out seconds/lastUpdate
* Fixed overlay flowing (for real this time)
* Fixed wording for AV syncing, will just send the sync if the count down is 0 seconds, also will correctly send the sync message to party or raid depending on how many people are there

* Removed sync.lua, won't likely be adding syncing of timers back because it's useless 99% of the time, and just adds more code thats a pain in general
* Added module in for doing AV sync queuing, no longer will plug into the overlay as the time before queue is pretty low, slash command is /av

* Fixed AB timers not removing when leaving AB
* Click action for AB actually works
* AV module implemented, should fully work with interval alerts, speed up at <=2 minutes left and capture timers, and reinforcement gain through mines

* Implemented the faction break down to the Alliance/Horde score buttons
* Removed shifting of name in score, it's ugly since it's so close
* Fixed SSPVP:ParseNode doing a string.lower

* Base Arathi Basin support is in, just does timers currently
* Implemented all the arena features, inspect/player points, (L) next to name, float game played and /arena for conversion
* Added all the reformat/battleground things like auto appending server, blocking raid leave/join, timer to start, auto release
* Added all the score modifications, coloring names, hiding class icon and enemy/friendly levels (Alliance/Horde break down not in yet)
* Overlays should fully work now, changed so instead of just clicking the overlay to active the OnClick you now have to hold a modifier key down to prevent accidental clicks
