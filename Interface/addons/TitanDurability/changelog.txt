About Titan Panel [Durability]:

Original code from Titan Durability by tekkub and Titan by TitanMod / Adsertor
Gold formatting code, shamelessly "borrowed" from Auctioneer

Additional to the built-in Durability-Addon coming with Titan-Panel (Titan Repair), this addon can also display the discounted repaircosts for friendly, honored, revered and exalted reputation.

This is not a replacement for Titan Repair, since Titan Durability is NOT a "repair" addon - and will never be.

Features:
- display of durability and repair cost for equipped items and items in your bags
- display of detailed durability status for equiped items on Titan Panel tooltip
- all durability informations can be displayed on Titan Panel
- total repair cost (equipped + inventory)
- you can see the most damaged item on titan panel
- option to show your item names instead of just the names of the slots
- all repair costs displayable with selected discount (friendly (5%), honored (10%), revered (15%) and exalted (20%) or all together if u want)
- durability and repair cost is only calculated out of combat
- currently works with english, german, french, simplified chinese and spanish client ... should be working with all other language versions too - just test it :)

This is a continued version of Tekkub's Titan Panel [Durability]
