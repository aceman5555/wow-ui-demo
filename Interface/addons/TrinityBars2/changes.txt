- The toggles for the dock editors, bindings editors and button editors now toggle simple/advanced mode on a left or right click respectively.
- Fixes for both Blizzard macros and Trinity Bars macros
- Fix for spells that have () in the spell name, like druid Mangle(Cat)

20400.3

- The GCD for druid abilities like mangle should trigger now
- New buttons should react to right-clicks now without having to relog.
- A new font has been chosen for keybinds, hopefully clearer for many users.

20400.4

- Changes to buttons of type "action", they should react as expected now.
- More minor changes to setting up macros for proper icon selection.
- Some performance optimizations

20400.5

- Added a "spell count" feature. This feature is toggled per button. This feature will show you how many of the button's current spell you can cast/perform based on mana/rage/energy left. This feature is CPU intensive if used for many buttons, just FYI.
- Storing non action buttons should no longer give the "Button storage is full" error.
- Some more optimizations
- Some small bug fixes

20400.5.1
- Small fix for the line 3071 error (I hope :) )

- buttons of type "spell" should upgrade their spells properly if they were the max rank prior to learning a new rank.

20400.5.3
- a small tweak to the max rank spells upgrading for buttons of type "spell"

20400.6
- Hopefully final adjustment for buttons of type "spell" to uprank properly.
- Using the shift-click micro adjust should now follow the current dock.
- Buttons of type "item" should now properly reflect random "of the" items.
- Minimap button should now adjust position based on minimap shape.
- Fixed macros not saving when editing macros and jumping from one to the other while the macro editor is open.
- Added the ability to define paging/stance/aspect transitions in the advanced dock editor.
- Transparent bars set to "trans up" on battle should no longer "trans up" on mouseover too.
- The cast bars should no longer flash in red (failure) when it should not.

20400.7
- Changed the draw layer of macro names on buttons.
- Added a new event to help keep item button counts updated.
- Fixed an issue where the minimap button "creeped" along the minimap each time the main menu was opened.
- Added many new elements to the localization file.
- Fixed the issue of the cursor picking up a spell while over a button and the buttons are locked.
- Added coloring options to the castbar and xpbar addons in the advanced dock config menu.
- Added a new method of loading button contents only from templates
- Buttons of type "spell" should now have the proper tooltip based on the enhanced tooltip setting.
- Some more performance improvements.
- Added a new option in the main menu. When enabled, Left-dragging a button will fully pick up the contents, while right-dragging will copy the contents. Currently only works for spells of type "spell", "macro" and "item".
- Added "Retreat" and "Retreat+Mouseover" options to the "Transparency-Up" option.
- Reverted a change to alt/ctrl/shift bars to always set themselves to the last known state instead of the default of '0'. This will help with bars that get stuck when more than 2 modifiers are held down.
- Added a new template manager. Shift-click the main minimap button to open.
- Macros that use slot numbers should now reflect the item in the slot.
