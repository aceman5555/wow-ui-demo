* The chat message sent when a player puts down a Train Set will no longer be sent if you are marked as AFK.
* The sound played when a player puts down a Toy Train Set will only play if you have set up TrainAlert to NOT disable sound effects. It was rather pointless playing the sound when sound effects were turned off.

* TrainAlert will now tell you when someone uses The Mischief Maker on you.
* TrainAlert will now check how far away a person using a Toy Train set is from you. If they are within trading range (11.11 yards), you will be warned about the train. If they aren't in range, you won't be alerted.
* TrainAlert no longer sends chat messages regarding people using a Piccolo of the Flaming Fire.

* Bumped TOC to 40300.

== Version 1.7.4 (November 25th 2011) ==

* Removed all references to the player regarding Turkey Shooters. It should now say '<Name> used a Turkey Shooter!', rather than '<Name' blasted you with a Turkey Shooter!'. Thanks to Veyska for mentioning this to me.

Special Pilgrim's Bounty Update!

* TrainAlert will now tell you when someone throws a Party G.R.E.N.A.D.E. nearby.
* TrainAlert will now tell you when someone uses a Turkey Shooter either nearby or on you.
* Added Debug Mode. This will tell you the name, ID number and type of each spell cast on you by another player. Use it to find more annoying spells and items. Once you find one, send the information acquired via debug to me via a Curse PM.

**If this update gives you problems, delete the addon's Saved Variables. That worked for me.**
